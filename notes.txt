Protocols are a set of rules that two sides agree to follow to exchange information over a network.
Each device on a network can be identified by its IP address.
If a client wants to connect to a server, it needs to know the server's IP address. Therefore the need of a socket. A socket is a channel that allows the client and server to communicate with each other.

There are various protocols that can be used to communicate over a network:

    1. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for transferring files
    2. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email
    3. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for transferring web pages
    4. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for reliable data transfer
    5. and many more

Information is sent through the socket via TCP. TCP splits the information into smaller chunks called packets.

A port number is a number that listens for a particular request on a server.
The structure of a port number is: ${protocol}://${hostname}:${port}
${hostname} can be an IP address, domain name, or localhost.
