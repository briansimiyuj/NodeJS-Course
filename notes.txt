To read a stream:

Let's create a README file and add a number of text to it.
Let's import http and fs modules.

    1. Create a readable stream using the `createReadStream(${__dirname + "${fileName}"}, {encoding})`method on the fs module and store it in a variable.
        i. Import __filename and __dirname from the node.js core module.
        ii. Use the __dirname and __filename to create a path to the file.

    NB: If we don't specify the encoding, the data will be returned as a buffer.

    2. Create a listen event once we receive every stream of data.
