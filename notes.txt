A POST request is a method that asks the server to accept/store data which is sent in the HTTP request body. Mostly used to submit forms.

In our form, let's add a method attribute and set it to "POST" and an action attribute and set it to "/contact".
We need to parse the request body and get the data from it. To do that, we need to add a body-parser middleware.
To install body-parser, we run:

    `npm i body-parser`

Then assign the middleware to a variable (URLencodedParser)

When handling the POST request to "/contact", we:

1. Use the URLencodedParser middleware as the second parameter to parse form data
2. Access the parsed form data through request.body
3. Pass both query string data (request.query) and form data (request.body) to the view

After successfully submitting the form, we need to create a new view to show the user that their message was sent and render it.
