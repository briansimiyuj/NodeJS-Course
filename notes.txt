Computers don't understand JavaScript.

Therefore, there a JavaScript engine that converts JavaScript into a language that the computer can understand (machine code).

Node JS is written in C++ but it allows us to write JavaScript on the server side.
The JavaScript engine that converts JavaScript into machine code is called V8
V8 is written in C++
JavaScript code is passsed to the V8 engine which converts it into machine code.
V8 is what makes JavaScript run on the server.
