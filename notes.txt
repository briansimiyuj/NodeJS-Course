To write a stream is very similar to reading a stream. We use `createWriteStream(${__dirname + "${fileName}"})` method on the fs module, which we will assign to a variable (myWriteStream).
Now we want to write a stream every time we read a stream.
We will use write(${data}) method on myWriteStream.
This will create a new file and write to the data that we read.
