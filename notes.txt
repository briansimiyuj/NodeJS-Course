package.json is a file that keeps track of all the packages that are installed in a project.
To create a package.json file, we run `npm init -y` command.
When we install a dependancy, it gets added to the package.json file. 
To install a dependancy, we run `npm i ${package-name} --save` command.
Once the dependancies are listed in the package.json file, we can run `npm i` command to install all the dependancies.
