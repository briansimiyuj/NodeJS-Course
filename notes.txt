Node Package Manager (NPM) is a bunch of JavaScript files that are used to install and manage third-party packages through the command line.
A package is a collection of JavaScript files that are used to perform a specific task.
NPM comes installed with Node.js.

To install a package, we use:

    `npm install ${package-name}` or `npm i ${package-name}`

In this case, let's install express package: `npm i express`.
Once the package is installed, node_modules directory will be created in the project directory. This is where all the packages are stored.
Packages are dependant on each other. That's why once we install a package, it will automatically install all the packages that the package is dependant on.
