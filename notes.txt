There are 2 ways to create a directory:

    1. Synchronously
    2. Asynchronously

In this commit, we will learn how to create a directory synchronously.

We use `mkdirSync($directoryName)` method on the fs module 

Before we go to the asynchronous way, let's see how to delete a directory synchronously.

We use `rmSync($directoryName)` method on the fs module, if the directory is empty. But if it's not empty, we use `rmSync($directoryName, {recursive: true})` method on the fs module.
