Let's separate our styles into a CSS file. Then we try to link it to our index.ejs file like we would with a regular HTML file.
When look at the browser, we can see that the styles are not being applied.
That's where Middleware comes in.

A middleware is code that runs between the request and the response. For example, we have set up a route to the contact parameter and sent a string as a response. Before we send the response, we have a console.log() statement. This is a middleware.
