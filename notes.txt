Partial views help us to share the same layout for multiple pages.

Let's create a partial view for the navbar (./views/partials/nav.ejs) and create a markup for the navbar.   
To include the partial view in the layout, we need to use the following syntax: 

    `<%- include("${partial_view_path}") %>` (Refer to ./views/profile.ejs ln 57)

Let's change all HTML files into views (EJS files) and store them in the views/pages folder.
Include the nav partial in all the pages.

Now if we want to change the navbar, we only need to change the partial view and it will be reflected in all the pages.
