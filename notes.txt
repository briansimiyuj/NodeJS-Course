To create a server:

    1. We need to import HTTP module
    2. We use http.createServer() method and assign it to a variable called server
        a. The method takes a callback function as an argument which takes two arguments: request and response
        b. The request object contains information about the incoming request
        c. The response object contains methods for sending a response for a request

Headers are key-value pairs that contain additional information about the request or response. It's like the head section in HTML.

Headers contain the following:

    - Content-Type: The type of content in the body of the response (text/html, application/json, etc.)
    - statusCode: The HTTP status code of the response (200, 404, 500, etc.)
    - body: The body of the response (text, JSON, etc.)

    3. We use the listen() method to start the server, and pass in the port number, IP address, and a callback function that will be called when the server starts listening for requests. `listen(${port}, ${ip}, ${callback})`
