A POST request is a method that asks the server to accept/store data which is sent in the HTTP request body. Mostly used to submit forms.

In our form, let's add a method attribute and set it to "POST" and an action attribute and set it to "/contact".
We need to parse the request body and get the data from it. To do that, we need to add a body-parser middleware.
To install body-parser, we run:

    `npm i body-parser`
