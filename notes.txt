Piping is a faster way to write and read streams
We use pipe(${writableStream}) method on readable stream to write to a writable stream
This will create a new file and write to it the data we read.
Now let's pipe the data to a response object in our server. So that we can send the data to the client. (Response object is a writable stream).
