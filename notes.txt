Partial views help us to share the same layout for multiple pages.

Let's create a partial view for the navbar (./views/partials/nav.ejs) and create a markup for the navbar.   
To include the partial view in the layout, we need to use the following syntax: 

    `<%- include("${partial_view_path}") %>` (Refer to ./views/profile.ejs ln 57)
