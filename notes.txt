There are 3 types of streams in Node.js:

    1. Readable streams - allow us to read data from a source. When we receive a request from a client, we receive a readable stream.
    2. Writable streams - allow us to write data to a destination. When we send a response to a client, we send a writable stream.
    3. Duplex streams - allow us to read and write data to a source or destination.
