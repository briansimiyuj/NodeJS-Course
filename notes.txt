In Node JS, we can read files using fs

Let's create a file called README.md and add some text

    1. We need to import fs from fs.
    2. Then use readFileSync() method on it. It takes takes two arguments: file path and character encoding. readFileSync("${filePath}", "${encoding}"). readFileSync is synchronous; means it will wait for the file to be read before moving on to the next code.
