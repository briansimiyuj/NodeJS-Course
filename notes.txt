In Node JS, we don't write all our code in one file. We write it in multiple files, each file containing a specific functionality. These files are called modules. We call these modules whenever we want to use a specific functionality.

Let's create a new file called count.js and create a function called count.

If we want to use this function in another file, we need to export it from the count.js. We do this by adding the `export` keyword before the function. 

Then in the file where we want to use the function, we need to import it using the `import { functionName } from ${"filePath"}` syntax.

Before that, we need to tell Node JS that we want to use ES6 syntax. We need to create a file called package.json in the root directory of our project. This file will contain information about our project. We can create this file by running the command `npm init -y`.

Add the following code to the package.json file:

    `"type": "module"`
