Query parameters (also known as query strings) are key-value pairs that get attached to URLs to pass additional data in HTTP requests. They appear after the '?' character in a URL and help customize or filter the request.
If there are multiple query parameters, they are separated by '&' characters, for example:

    `https://www.example.com/search?${queryParameter1}=${value1}&${queryParameter2}=${value2}`

In our contact route, let's log out the request query. We can see an object with all the query parameters and their values.
