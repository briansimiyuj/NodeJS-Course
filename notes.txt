To create a server:

    1. We need to import HTTP module
    2. We use http.createServer() method and assign it to a variable
        a. The method takes a callback function as an argument which takes two arguments: request and response
        b. The request object contains information about the incoming request
        c. The response object contains methods for sending a response for a request
