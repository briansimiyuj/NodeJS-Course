The server consistently returns an identical response object structure across all page requests.
In real world, this would be absurd. Therefore, we need to have different response objects for different pages. This is where routing systems come in.
The request object has a pathname property that contains the path of the URL. We can use this to determine which page to render.
For example, if the pathname is "/" or "/home", we can render the home page.
If we try to request a different URL, the browser will keep loading the page until it times out.
