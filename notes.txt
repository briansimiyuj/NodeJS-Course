Let's separate our styles into a CSS file. Then we try to link it to our index.ejs file like we would with a regular HTML file.
When look at the browser, we can see that the styles are not being applied.
That's where Middleware comes in.

A middleware is code that runs between the request and the response. For example, we have set up a route to the contact parameter and sent a string as a response. Before we send the response, we have a console.log() statement. This is a middleware.

To use a middleware, we apply use() method on the express instance.

The use() method accepts a route (optional) and a callback function as parameters. The callback function typically takes request, response, and next as its arguments, enabling middleware logic.
The next() function is a parameter passed to middleware functions and is used to pass control to the next middleware in the request-response cycle.

In order to see the styles, use method can can take a route and `express.static()` method. Which is a built-in middleware function in Express. It is used to serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
