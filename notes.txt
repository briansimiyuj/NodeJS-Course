Event Emitter allows us to create custom events and handle them in our applications.

There are two main steps in using EventEmitter:

    1. Creating and emitting events 
    2. Listening to events and performing actions

In this commit, we will create a simple event emitter that emits an event.

    1. Import the EventEmitter class from the events module.
    2. Create an instance of the EventEmitter class. For example:
        `const ${eventEmitter} = new EventEmitter().`
    3. ${eventEmitter} will have on method that takes two arguments:
        a. The name of the event to listen for.
        b. A callback function that will be called when the event is emitted.
    4. To emit an event, use the emit method of the EventEmitter instance and pass the name of the event and any data to be passed to the callback function.
