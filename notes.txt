In Node JS, we can read files using fs

Let's create a file called README.md and add some text

    1. We need to import fs from fs.
    2. Then use readFileSync() method on it. It takes takes two arguments: file path and character encoding. readFileSync("${filePath}", "${encoding}"). readFileSync is synchronous; means it will wait for the file to be read before moving on to the next line.

We can also write to a file:

    1. We use writeFileSync() method. It takes two arguments: file path and data to write. writeFileSync("${filePath}", "${data}")

We also have asynchronous versions of these methods:

    1. readFile 
    2. writeFile

Both methods takes three arguments: file path, data to write, and a callback function to execute after the file has been read or written.
